# Capital One Summit Coding Challenge - Bike Share Data
The Capital One Summit Coding Challenge required using Bike Share data from Los Angeles to answer 
several questions below (including Bonus questions) and provide visuals/graphics.

1. Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.
2. Which start/stop stations are most popular?
3. What is the average distance traveled?
4. How many riders include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute?

(Optional) Bonus features you may want to include to stand out:

How does ridership change with seasons? Types of passes used, trip duration, etc

Is there a net change of bikes over the course of a day? If so, when and
where should bikes be transported in order to make sure bikes match travel patterns?

What is the breakdown of Trip Route Category-Passholder type combinations? What might make a particular combination more popular?

This was completed using R and the website was made through R Shiny and shinyapps.io
